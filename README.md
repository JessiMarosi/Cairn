# Cairn
### Developer Infrastructure Software

Cairn is a local-first, cross-platform developer workbench for secure, auditable, AI-assisted software development.  
It supports coding, debugging, auditing, and collaboration while keeping all projects private and under user control.

## Project Status
Cairn is in early development. Interfaces, schemas, and security boundaries are being finalized before core functionality is implemented.

## Philosophy
- Local-first by default
- No required cloud accounts
- Explicit, on-disk projects
- Security and auditability are core features, not add-ons
